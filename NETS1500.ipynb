        "To run the simulation, simply click on ‘Run All’ under the ‘Runtime’ tab. Then, the simulation will give you your secret number and prompt you to input your name (you need to scroll to section titled **RUN SIMULATION**). After doing so, you will begin the rounds. For each round, input your quote as buy price and sell price in the format ‘buy@sell’ where buy is an integer and sell is an integer. Ideally, buy is less than sell since it doesn’t make sense to want to buy something for more than you want to sell it for, but the code lets you play around with the numbers however you want. At the end of the simulation, you will be given your opponent’s numbers and their strategies and your own PNL. \n",
